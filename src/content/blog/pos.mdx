Native POS means your in-store system and your online store speak the same language automatically.

But not every business needs this.

If you run a bakery with a few items, or a service business with limited in-person sales then two seperate systems would likely work fine for your business.

### When a separate website and separate POS is totally fine

Using Squarespace, Wix, or WordPress with their built-in ecommerce features works well when:

- You have simple inventory
- You sell a small number of items
- Most sales happen online (or most happen in-store, not both)
- You don’t change products often
- You don’t mind updating inventory in two places once in a while
- You don’t rely on detailed reporting or advanced sales analytics

For a lot of small businesses, this setup is perfectly fine.

If you use WordPress, Wix, or Squarespace and a separate POS, you’re juggling two systems:

1. Website inventory
2. In-store POS inventory When native POS integration becomes more important

Native POS helps most when in-store and online sales both matter, and your inventory changes often.

With separate systems you manage:

1. Website inventory
2. In-store POS inventory

Meaning you update one when the other changes. Native POS gives you:

- One “source of truth” for inventory
- Online and in-person orders in the same system
- Staff only learning one interface
- One set of reports
- Fewer sync issues
- Hardware and software in one ecosystem (register, card reader, online store all match)
- Less setup, fewer moving parts

This matters more as the business gets busier, not necessarily when it’s new.

### A middle option: Square and a website builder

You can use Square’s POS and a website builder like:

- WordPress (Square plugin)
- Wix (Square integration)
- Squarespace (Square sync)

This gives you the best of both worlds:

Your website can look however you want, while inventory syncs into Square’s POS.

Great middle ground for:

- Retail shops
- Cafés -Market vendors

Any business that wants decent control over their website without giving up POS sync

### Summary

You only need native POS if you handle a lot of in-person sales AND online sales.

If you’re:

- A small business
- Selling a handful of items
- Not dealing with rapid inventory changes
- Mostly focused on having a professional website

Then Squarespace/Wix/WordPress ecommerce alone can be great for you.

If you’re:

- Busy in-store
- Busy online
- Handling lots of SKUs
- Wanting stronger reporting
- Want hardware + website in one system
- Or you want a platform built for growing ecommerce (Shopify fits here perfectly)

Then Square, Shopify or Toast makes more sense.
