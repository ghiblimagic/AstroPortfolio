If you:

- Have the time and energy to create a website yourself.
- Do not want to spend $$$ to team up with a developer.

Then this guide is made for you!

Picking a website builder can feel like speed-dating, with apps all swearing they’re “the one.” In reality, each builder is only "the perfect match" for specific situations. This guide helps you cut through the noise and find the website builder(s) that actually match your business.

Since this is just a general guide, you'd still have to research the finalists to see which have all the features you might need.

If you’d rather save some time and avoid headaches, then reach out to your local friendly developer or developer agency!

Note: This article will not cover industry specific web builders like BentoBox since most new businesses won't need these and they're pricey. General site builders like Wix, Squarespace, WordPress ect will work fine for most smaller businesses.

### Do you just need a website for credibility?

Then you likely just need:

- A professional landing page
- Hours
- Services
- Contact Form

Resist the urge to go crazy with plugins or customization. A one page Carrd website or one of the simple multi-page website builders (Squarespace, Wix, Hostinger, ect) will likely be enough for your business.

### Aleady know what a plugin and domain name is?

<div class=" text-center">
  <ButtonALink
    href="#flowchart"
    label="Skip to FlowChart"
  />
</div>
### What is a plugin, extension or app

These are "apps" you can install to give extra features to your website. It acts the same way as a mobile phone, where you'll access an "app store" in the website builder, and choose which ones you need. Some are free, others have monthly costs.

### What is a domain name?

Every website has an IP address ex: 192..168.1.1 In human terms, this would be someone's full legal name like: Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.

A domain name is a human readable name, so it would be a nickname like: Professor Dumbledore. Buying a domain name means you're buying a unique nickname that people can use to find your website.

### Should built-in POS integration be a top priority?

Alas this article was getting long, so I moved the native integration topic to a separate short article:

<div class=" text-center">

    href="/blog/pos"
    label="Native POS article"
    download={false}

</div>

### Which businesses might not need a website?

**Businesses that can potentially thrive with just social media:**

1. Hyper-local service businesses or well established business that get customers from word of mouth.
2. Appointment-based professionals who book through platforms.
3. Food businesses that primarily use delivery apps.
4. Businesses that only sell on marketplaces (Etsy, Ebay ect).
5. B2B companies that land clients through relationships.

In these cases, even a cheap website might not have enough ROI (return on investment) to use your limited money on, versus spending that money instead on advertising, ect.

If a website is likely to have minimal ROI and but you want a very simple website consider:

- Carrd $9/year (can use the free domain that is included, or buy and add your own)
- Square (free plan, but very limited, must use the free .square.site domain)
- Wix (free with ads, have to use the free wix domain)
- Wordpress.com (free, but very limited, must use the free wordpress.com domain)

### Potential Pros to Having a Website:

**1\. Improved SEO, potential clients can find you with a google search easier**

High SEO = Make google rank your website higher in google search results.

This means if you're a plumbing business and users type in "local emergency plumber near me" into google, your business likely won't pop up near the top! Because to google, your FB/Instagram/ect is just a part of that social media company!

If google automatically created a google business profile for you or you created it, then you'll get some SEO benefits from that. But with a fast website you can improve how high up you're listed in google search results, which can lead to more clients/$$$ IF they're likely to search for you with google.

Even if your business will get the majority of its leads through your social presence, the other benefits below might be enough to consider making a cheap website.

Special note: If your company is not very unique, or there's a ton of local competition that is very similar, it will take more effort to get a higher SEO ranking.

**2\. Your company is not blocked behind a social medias "sign in to view" message**

If a person sees you're only on social media and sees they have to sign in or make account, they might skip you and look at your competition instead.

**3\. Finding menus, store hours, address, ect is much easier**

Most users aren't going to want to look through a ton of images to find the information for a business they have no connection to. Especially if the user is not familiar with the layout of these social media websites.

However, if you create a free google business profile, your hours of operation and address will at least be easy to find.

**4\. Don't have to worry about social media suspending your core business page**

Even if you are careful with how you word your posts, there's a chance something unexpected could trigger the suspension.

But if you have a website, users will know they can get the information they need from that, so you won't be hemorrhaging as much money while you get the suspension situation fixed.

**5\. Looks more professional. A website can make you look more serious than your competition**

If a user has to choose between a business only listed on social media, or one that has an active social media and a website, they'll likely choose the business with a website.

Only using social media makes it easier for your competition to win over potential customers from your business.

**6\. A website signals your business is still open**

Meanwhile a social media page that hasn't been updated in several months or a year might of closed down.

## Deeper Breakdown

The cost listed below is for the plans without anything added. The **cost** **does not include**:

- Cost of the apps/ plugins you'll choose (since its different for each business). Some small businesses can make do with free apps/ plugins.
- Cost of the domain name if its not included in the price (usually cheap ~$10-$20). A domain name is your website name ex: janetspellman.com.
- Cost of a premium template, if you decide to use one.

### **Google Business Profile**

- Perfect if:
  - you only need people to find you on Google, quickly.
- Skip it if:
  - You need an actual website.
- Difficulty:
  - ⭐
- Cost:
  - Free
- Best For:
  - Local visibility, great for “I need something NOW.”
  - Most businesses should claim/create a google business profile, its free, relatively easy to setup and its often the first thing that potential clients see about your business.
- Customer Support:
  - Difficult to get a hold of if you are unlucky enough to run into issues but its free, so worth trying to get your google business profile setup anyway. Usually takes a few weeks for the business to be verified.

- Migration & Security & Accessibility:
  - N/A, this is a google listing not a website.
- SEO:
  - If you have this and link your website, it will help improve your SEO. Because google like's to see your website linked on other sites, to boost its trustworthiness.
- Pros:
  - Free, will help people find your business to potentially lead to some more sales
  - Easy to setup
- Cons:
  - Looks less professional if you don’t add a website to your google business profile, but it’s better than nothing and easy to setup.
  - Although you can post your menu as images to get around setting up a website, it requires more work for customers to click through images to find the menu images.

  </div>

### **Google Sites**

- Perfect if:
  - You just want a basic website with maybe a contact form, gallery and map at most, budget and technical hassle need to be minimal, you're okay with a basic design, no complex features.
  - You want a short term site for an event or a report.
  - For a very simple store, you could use a template which gives you access to a small store, mostly through JotForm integrations.
  - If your organization also uses Google Drive and other Google products, the native integration can help a lot.
- Skip it if:
  - You need a site that will grow as your business grows. However, you could always start with a free Google Site and move to a more robust page builder later.
  - Want to avoid having a basic looking site, customization is limited.
  - Want to have the highest SEO ranking possible (ranking high on google search results)
  - Need a true E-commerce store.
- Difficulty:
  - ⭐
- Cost:
  - Free website builder and hosting with a google account, free SSL cert, no tiers, no ads, there is a tiny, semi-transparent "Report Abuse" button in the bottom left.
  - Although you can use the free Google.sites subdomain I highly recommend buying a custom domain. Why? Because lots of scams use sites with google.sites subdomains because its free, so some socials/websites filter out google.site subdomains. Also it looks more professional to have a cheap custom domain added to your site.
  - "Google Sites are free to build, host, and maintain with a Google or Gmail account. There are no web hosting fees. If, however, you are using Google Sites in conjunction with Google Workspace, the cost is rolled into the user license fee of all plans."
- Trial:
  - N/A its free
- Best For:
  - Simple blogs, bio sites, portfolios, simple websites, internal team sites, disposable sites for one time events or reports
- Customer Support:
  - "Google Sites support for a free Gmail account is basically no existent from Google Inc. themselves. There isn't a way to submit a ticket or talk to a Google representative. With a Google Workspace subscription the situation improves, but it comes at a cost there. However, there is an active Help Community of product experts, which is a forum type system." https://www.kirksvillewebdesign.com/google-sites-developer/google-sites-news/free-website-builder-plans
- Migration:
  - You can only migrate it to sharepoint (used for corporate intranets) otherwise you'd have to rebuild from scratch https://cloudiway.com/solutions/google-sites-migration/

- Security:
  - Your website data is stored on Google's servers, which could raise concerns about data privacy and security for some people.
- Accessibility (ADA/WCAG compliance):
  - Not great for accessibility but there are guides to make use of the accessibility features it does have:
    - such as this 7 minute video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSsY9Wr0WD0&t=444s
  - https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/engcom-wiki/web/accessibility/google-sites-accessibilty
- How easy to hand-off to employees:
  - Very Easy to add someone, and its a very simple website builder https://support.google.com/sites/answer/97934?hl=en
  - "If, at some point, I want/need to turn webmaster duties over to someone, it wouldn't take eons to show them what to do. I've shown other embroiderers (most of whom are not terribly techie) how to start their sites, and all have been successful. ... it's perfect for the groups I work with (demographics tilt toward senior citizen)" https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleSites/comments/1jih1vj/comment/mjlw7bb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button
  - "I onboarded many nonprofits onto Google Sites because they used Docs and Sheets, but also because your average person can easily make updates." https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleSites/comments/1jih1vj/would_anyone_actually_recommend_google_sites/
- E-commerce:
  - "The lack of a proper CMS makes the prospect of managing a large ecommerce site on Google Sites impractical. However, templates have been made which utilize Pay Now buttons and simple storefronts. https://www.kirksvillewebdesign.com/google-sites/google-sites-templates/business-ecommerce" Most seem to use jotform to create a simple store
- Widgets or App Store
  - No App store but you can embed code (widgets into your site to extend its functionality slightly)
  - https://sites.google.com/site/horstwebdesign/integrations-widgets-apps-and-add-ons
  - Examples of premium "apps", in this case its just code you'll copy and paste into Google Sites: https://www.commoninja.com/widgets?via=googlesites
- SEO:
  - Although google site's FAQ says it can rank (have high SEO), so many other say its been terrible for SEO so I'd be wary if you want to get the highest google search rankings. The SEO features it offers is basic, unlike the advanced SEO offered by some other site builders, so I'd be surprised if you could achieve the highest SEO ranking with Google Sites.
    - Through guide for improving SEO: https://www.googlesites-seo.com/
  - "There is nothing preventing Google Sites from performing well in search. We've provided some tips to help Google Sites users with SEO. https://sites.google.com/site/horstwebdesign/seo-tips"
  - "Although Classic Google Sites used to support entry of meta data like meta descriptions, New Google Sites has been simplified. It allows:
    - Site Title
    - Page Title
    - Heading Tags
    - Image Alt Tags

    In addition, Google Analytics and Google Search Console (formerly Webmaster Tools) can track and make sure your website is in good SEO form. For more information on SEO, please see the videos of Matt Cutts, Google Webmaster Tools representative or read our complete SEO guide for New Google Sites. https://www.kirksvillewebdesign.com/google-sites/seo"

- Pros:
  - Free with a google account!
  - All google sites are made to work on desktop and mobile devices, so it'll save you time troubleshooting the apperance of the site on different screens.
  - If your organization also uses Google Drive and other Google products, the native integration can help a lot.
  - You can get templates through their store, theres both free and premium templates: https://www.kirksvillewebdesign.com/google-sites/google-sites-templates
  - "I’ve used Wordpress, Wix, and Squarespace, and just really enjoy the simplicity. There are great prebuilt templates out there, but even using Canva and a few embeds from other platforms and you can have a decent site." https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleSites/comments/1jih1vj/comment/mjs9emf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button
  - " We are a school using Google Workspace for Education, basically all of the Google apps like docs, sheets, slides etc. I decided on Google Sites as it is collaborative, and our team could easily work on it, adding content and pulling in images from Google Photos. Most of the team have no experience in web designing but it was easy to set up and we have no complaints!" https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleSites/comments/1jih1vj/comment/mjtzq4q/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button
  - Google sites used to share your google drive or google worksplace storage, but that is no longer the case for new google sites.
- Cons:
  - Minimal customization, so the sites tend to look basic.
  - It only supports minimal blogging features.
  - If you don't use a custom domain and stick with the google.sites domain, some sites such as reddit filter out google site links because of the high amount of scams and malware that create free google sites to trick potential victims.

- Security:
  - Handled by Carrd, you don’t have to do anything.
- Accessibility (ADA/WCAG compliance):
  - Since Carrd sites are simpler they’re more likely to be accessible. However there’s nothing about “we meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA” for the templates, so if you legally need to meet this requirements or want to care for all your potential customers, you’d likely have to manually check for accessibility compliance.

- E-commerce:
  - No built in E-commerce features.

  - However with Ecwid you are limited to 5 products on a starter plan, 100 to venture, ect. No free plans. Heres a through article which compares shopify to Ecwid: https://www.stylefactoryproductions.com/blog/shopify-vs-ecwid

  - Many SEO tools are behind a small paywall ( must have a Pro Standar or higher plan). But Carrd is so much cheaper than other web builders its not a big issue
    - Can add meta tags (on Pro Standard or higher plan )
    - add google analytics ID to see where your traffic is coming from and what people are searching for, to help tweak your SEO.

- Pros:
  - Very affordable!
  - Easy to use
- Cons:
  - For single page websites. Though if you want it to "look" like a multi page website you can use their sections feature. However it won't have the SEO benefits of a true multi page website.

- Migration:
  - Very limited and painful to deal with
  - Some things can be exported to WordPress, but its hit or miss.

- E-commerce
  - Available for all plans, but at different levels for different services, scroll down to "Accept payments and sell products and services" to see how it varies by plan. Free plans currently have a 2% online store transaction fee and 7% digital content and memberships transaction fee https://www.squarespace.com/pricing
  - Its weak when trying to sell physical products "it lacks the full range of shipping and fulfillment options provided by Shopify, and also offers fewer payment options (for example, manual payments are not an option)." https://www.tooltester.com/en/reviews/squarespace-review/ecommerce/
  - "It’s possible to connect the store with fulfilment providers like ShipStation, ShipBob and Spocket, but not with marketplaces like AliExpress or Amazon Fulfillment." https://www.tooltester.com/en/reviews/squarespace-review/ecommerce/
  - Sell unlimited products and services, send invoices for free, sell content and memberships
  - Not as easy to use as other tools "it can be tricky to find certain settings (e.g. changing currency), and displaying product collections on select pages isn’t very intuitive. The editor’s behaviour was a bit clunky at times." & advanced ecommerce features require one of the higher tier plans https://www.tooltester.com/en/reviews/squarespace-review/ecommerce/
  - " can include over 40 different types of content (e.g. videos, Instagram feeds, calendars, forms for product customization). There’s also the ability to add Amazon product listings and Opentable reservation forms. To increase your customers’ spend you are also able to show ‘related items’." https://www.tooltester.com/en/reviews/squarespace-review/ecommerce/
  - "One of the few e-commerce platforms that offer an integrated way for customers to leave product reviews, without needing to install an app. You can send an automated email to customers to request a review, or import them from Etsy." https://www.tooltester.com/en/reviews/squarespace-review/ecommerce/
  - "Each item can have up to 6 options and 250 variants (SKUs)." https://www.tooltester.com/en/reviews/squarespace-review/ecommerce/

  - Click on "view full feature list" to see all the pros and cons of each plan https://www.squarespace.com/pricing
  - Not great for international markets, because "While it supports 31 currencies, your store will only be able to display one at any time, meaning that when international customers visit, they won’t see their local currency until checkout." https://www.websitebuilderexpert.com/ecommerce-website-builders/squarespace-e-commerce-business-review/
  - https://www.squarespace.com/ecommerce-website
- Widgets or App Store:
  - Less extensions/plugins than other options

- Pros:
  - All in one platform, you can buy your domain within Squarespace.

  - Although there are less templates, they’re good quality so they’ll look professional on any screen size. So you’ll save the time you would of spent on these annoying adjustments.
- Cons:
  - Slightly pricier but everything is in one place
  - Can’t customize the templates as much as you can with other builders like WordPress BUT the templates that do exist are good quality.
  - If you have multiple locations, you'd have to make a site for each once since their e-commerce capabilities are more limited due to their smaller app market.

- How easy to hand-off to employees:
  - To give an employee access to **edit the Square Online website itself**, you must assign them a permission set that includes **Full Access** to the account. This permission level still prevents them from making major account changes like managing bank accounts, but grants the necessary permissions for website building and editing.
  - Note that basic team permissions are free, but if you need to create custom permission sets for different access levels to your online store and other features, you may need a subscription to the paid Team Management plan.

  - https://squareup.com/help/us/en/article/5437-manage-your-square-app-marketplace-subscriptions
  - Some apps will cost extra, but that’s the same for all website builders.
- SEO:
  - "SEO isn’t its strongest suit compared to Shopify or even Ecwid. While you can do basic SEO (meta titles, descriptions, alt text), its customization and flexibility for advanced SEO strategies (like structured data or technical SEO tweaks) are limited" https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/1i7ewhn/comment/m8p8jor/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

  - you might migrate later (it’s not easy). Or you don’t want to fiddle with an editor too much to get everything looking right.
- Difficulty:
  - ⭐⭐–⭐⭐⭐
- Cost:
  - Free (with Wix ads, have to use a [wixsite.com](http://wixsite.com) domain name)
  - Light $17/mo (no eCommerce capabilites, need Core or higher)
  - Core $29/mo
  - And some more expensive plans [https://www.wix.com/plans](https://www.wix.com/plans)

  - 14 day trial for premium plans

- Security:
  - Handles security, you don’t have to do anything.
- Accessibility (ADA/WCAG compliance):
  - Their “features comply with the highest global standards ([WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/))[.](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)” and they have guides about how to make sure your website is accessible:
    [htt](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)[ps://www.wix.com/accessibility](https://www.wix.com/accessibility)
  - These specific template were built with accessibility in mind (though you’d still have to manually enter alt text for images, which would be the same for any accessible template): [https://es.wix.com/website/templates/html/accessible](https://es.wix.com/website/templates/html/accessible)
- How easy to hand-off to employees:
  - More limitations. On a free Wix site (non-Studio), you only get 1 person beyond yourself who can be invited as a collaborator.
  - If you expect more than one person to edit the site you’ll need a paid plan:
  - [https://support.wix.com/en/article/inviting-people-to-contribute-to-your-site](https://support.wix.com/en/article/inviting-people-to-contribute-to-your-site)
- E-commerce:
  - If you need very basic or minimal e-commerce, their e-commerce will likely be enough for your business. If your business is mostly e-commerce then Shopify would be better.
  - E-commerce is a part of the Core and higher tier plans. The website makes it sound like its a seperate plan but its just going into detail about the eCommerce feature: https://www.wix.com/ecommerce/website
  - E-commerce takes a bit to set up, but you can do some decent customization with your shop (product filters, customize checkout, abandoned cart recovery)
  - To see a detailed breakdown of the e-Commerce capabilities of each plan scroll down to: Complete eCommerce platform "https://www.wix.com/plans"
  - "Add an extensive catalog of products to your online store with up to 1,000 variants each"
  - Dropshipping: "Add ready-to-sell products from Wix’s dropshipping platform, or third-party apps, and let suppliers take care of fulfillment."
  - Print on Demand: "Add your designs to hundreds of high-quality products, from t-shirts to headphones and let suppliers ship your custom merchandise directly to customers."
  - Marketplace: "Reach shoppers on Google, eBay, Etsy, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and Wish, and manage it all from your Wix dashboard."
  - Digital Products: "Sell digital products, such as music files, ebooks, online courses, images or gift cards."
  - Subscriptions: "Easily create and manage recurring products and sell subscriptions to generate a steady revenue stream."
  - Wix also as a POS system, for if you need to make sure your digital and physical store are linked tightly: https://www.wix.com/pos
    - My knee jerk reaction is to be wary since its built as an add on for a website builder than the business focus being the POS, but some people seem to have a good experience? If you want a well known POS square would be ideal.
    - About the POS: " Wix also allows me to have a plan B if the POS has issues for any reason....my phone. I can use my phone as a POS if the POS goes down or has connectivity issues, or the card reader dies because it got wet at a farmers market. The fact that I have an in pocket contingency plan at no extra cost is invaluable. We do farmers markets 4-5 days a week running 50-200 transactions per day." https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1b6cqku/comment/n5umkat/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

- Widgets or App Store:
  - Has more apps/plugins than Squarespace, over 300 that you can add to your site with a click to easily extend the functionality of your site.
  - https://www.wix.com/app-market
- SEO:
  - Seo tool goes beyond the basics: structured data, image compression, canoncial tags, seo tool walks you through optimization based on your niche. So beginner friendly but still useful for pros.
- Pros:
  - Offers a free plan, though you’ll have to deal with the “created by Wix” header.
  - More templates to choose from
  - Marketing templates, basic automation and integration with site behavior (sending emails based on users actions), app marketplace gives you access to chat bots and referral programs.
  - Robust analytics: emails, bookings, e-commerce all in one hub.

- Cons:
  - Can be a bit finicky to get it to look just right, might look off on different size screens. Trial and error to get it to look how you want. The “strip” layout is a bit weird to figure out.
  - Can't customize as much as you can with WordPress, but more customization options than most other builder.
  - All the options can be overwhelming at first
  - Template lock in: once you choose a template and start editing, you can't switch your progress to another template. You'd have to re-add everything from scratch to that new template.

  - However the site itself is easy to edit, so at the very minimum even if you have to share your login it'd be easy for them to update.
- E-commerce
  - no e-commerce features (creating a shop, managing inventory, shopping cart) BUT you can "connect your own checkout or payment processor (like Paypal, Gumroad or Stripe!)"
  - how to use paypal, gumroad or stripe https://docs.getsiimple.com/en/articles/9830861-does-siimple-offer-e-commerce-or-shop-features
- Widgets or App Store:
  - no app store
- SEO:
  - Great overview of their SEO with short and easy tips to maximize your SEO: https://getsiimple.com/blog/how-a-siimple-website-can-get-your-local-business-found-on-google/
  - Great for localized SEO , Siimples templates are built to be fast and mobile friendly, which lead to higher rankings.
  - Fields to enter page title, meta description, meta image and URL.

- Pros:

  - "you can cancel your subscription at any time. There are no contracts or hidden fees."
  - "Version History and Backups"
- Cons:
  - No blogging features
  - No multi page support
  - Won't scale with your business if it grows past a one page site

- SEO:
  - Offers basic SEO, you'd have to use external tools for more advanced SEO

  - all Ecwid plans come with unlimited bandwidth and storage at no extra cost.
- Con:
  - Some plugins have left ecwid so some businesses have had to move to shopify, if they needed those integrations.
  - Would need the venture plan or higher to use a custom domain, but each plan has a free .company.site domain
  - For large shops, or shops that expect to get big it can be limiting.
  - Limited customization options, but might be enough for a small shop that doesn't need heavy customization.
  - Weaker marketing tools, though you can use plugins to get access to more marketing tools
  - "Wix and Ecwid can work for small hobby shops, but they get messy once you add more products, variants, shipping rules, or start running ads. Shopify has better checkout, payment options, apps, and support for scaling. Plus if you ever want to run Meta/TikTok ads, Shopify integrates smoothly." https://www.reddit.com/r/EcommerceWebsite/comments/1n8i79t/comment/ncirbj9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

### **WordPress (In General)**

- Perfect if:
  - You want flexibility, something highly customizable, plugins, blogging, or long-term scalability.
- Skip it if:
  - You want something extremely simple right away.
- Note: Wordpress.com and WordPress.org are different, even though they use the same wordpress code. Wordpress.org is free, it just requires a little bit more setup. Wordpress.com handles hosting and security, but is pricier. They’ll be described below.
- E-commerce:
  - You can add a plugin, two popular ones are woocomcd amerce and bigcommerce
  - https://wordpress.org/plugins/bigcommerce/
  - https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/
    - https://woocommerce.com/posts/woocommerce-pricing/
  - " WooCommerce is unusable if you are not running any plugins on it. You need some expensive plugins that will cost you more than a year of shopify plan to really run on WooCommerce. Funnelkit for exemple cost $400 per year and, is just one of the best plugins out here for ecommerce.

    Need to pay at least 1 to 2k in plugins every single year, which is waaaay more than a basic shopify plan which costs around 400$ per year.

    Also have to add hosting cost. If you are running a pretty big store, you will need a strong server, which can cost some k every year too.

    To be short :

    If you are making sales on Shopify, WooCommerce will be insanely cheaper than Shopify as you will pay more in Shopify Fees for 1 month than a WooCommerce store for a year.

    If you are not making sales, WooCommerce will be more expensive. " https://www.reddit.com/r/woocommerce/comments/1cbqexb/comment/l10hty4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button

- Widgets or App Store:
  - Both wordpress.com and wordpress.org have app stores, though wordpress.com's store acceptance criteria is more strict, so you have less apps to choose from than with wordpress.org.
- SEO:
  - Both Wordpress.com and .org have apps that will let you fine tune your SEO.
- Pro:
  - Need a site that will grow with your business (scalable)
  - Can add e-commerce capabilities with plugins
  - Not locked into a specific platform like the other website builders, you can pick up your website and move to another platform if a hosting platform starts price gouging you.
  - Can be relatively cheap, as long as you don’t go crazy with adding plugins.
- Cons:
  - Bigger learning curve, takes time to get used to the setup.
- Examples:
  - Official “showcase” of real sites built on WordPress: [https://wordpress.org/showcase/](https://wordpress.org/showcase/)
  - Big brands using WordPress: [https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-site-examples/](https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-site-examples/)

### **Wordpress**.org

- Perfect if:
  - You want to be able to have total ownership of your site and do heavy customization at a relatively low price. And you don’t mind a higher learning curve and some more setup to get those benefits.
- Skip it if:
  - You don’t have the time to research hosting providers
  - If you choose basic WP hosting instead of WP managed hosting, you’d have to do technical maintenance manually. (Manually telling the plugins to update, and server side security updates, manual backups)
- Difficulty:
  - ⭐⭐⭐-⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Cost:
  - Depends on where you host it, WordPress itself is free. You’d chose your host and build your WordPress site there. Most hosts have 1-click install.
  - Hostinger $1.95/mo for 48 months 10.99/mo regular price at renewal
  - Bluehost: 2.95-3.00/mo starting
  - Dreamhost: starts at $2.59/mo
  - Also use care when selecting apps/plugins, these prices can stack up quietly ($10/mo here, $20/mo there)
- Trial:
  - Depends on the provider you chose.
- Customer Support:
  - Support varies based on your hosting platform
  - Theme and plugin support levels vary by the creators
- Migration:
  - This is where WordPress shines, its the easiest to move away from. You can easily switch to one hosting provider to another.
- Security:
  - If you use managed WordPress hosting they’ll handle security.
  - If you use a self-hosted solution you’d have to manually update plugins, themes and other security updates.
- Accessibility (ADA/WCAG compliance):
  - Varies by theme, these are some of the more accessible themes:
  - [https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/accessibility-ready/](https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/accessibility-ready/)
  - Though your plugins/apps might not be as accessible.
- How easy to hand-off to employees:
  - You can easily add editors with various permission levels:
  - [https://wordpress.com/support/invite-people/](https://wordpress.com/support/invite-people/)
- Pros:
  - Very customizable. Over 30,000 themes and 70,000 plugins to choose from to personalize your site, at various prices (some are free)
  - No themes or plugins are restricted, you can use any that you want.
  - Freedom to customize anything (themes, plugins, code)
  - Full access to files, database, server
  - You can heavily customize performance, caching, SEO
  - You can install SEO plugins like RankMath or yoast to help drive traffic to your site.
  - You can easily switch hosting providers, if one of them suddenly raises prices on you. Or you just want to take advantage of the “new client” plans by jumping around.
- Cons:
  - You have to deal with finding hosting. If you don’t choose a provider that offers “Managed WordPress hosting”, then you’d have to manually do plugin updates, security updates and backups.
  - You have to use more care when choosing themes and plugins, as not all of them are good quality. Look at reviews, avoid ones with low reviews.
  - You’ll have to deal with more technical aspects of your website, especially if you don’t use “Managed WordPress Hosting”

### **Wordpress.com**

- Difficulty: ⭐⭐⭐
- Perfect if:

  - There are discounts if you pay yearly or once every 2 years, saving up to 68%)

  - [https://wordpress.com/support/help-support-options/#how-to-contact-us](https://wordpress.com/support/help-support-options/#how-to-contact-us)

  - You can create an account for an employee and edit what permissions they have:
  - [https://learn.wordpress.org/lesson-plan/user-management/](https://learn.wordpress.org/lesson-plan/user-management/)
- Pros:
  - Unlimited traffic (visitors to your site) without surprise hosting bills, which makes the site very scalable (the site can handle your business growing over time)
  - Automatic updates & security
  - Fast performance without tuning, since its optimized to run WordPress websites
  - Zero server setup (no hosting configuration needed)
  - Less risk of “breaking” your site by accident
  - Personal and Premium plans have access to plugins now. The personal and premium plans used to have no access to premium themes or plugins so most avoided using it, but WP.com listened to the complaints and made those plans actually usable.
- Cons:
  - Can only export your WordPress site with higher tier plans, so if you want to leave WordPress.com you’d have to go to a higher tier to be able to export your WordPress site to a different host.
  - Slightly less customization because some plugins and themes won’t be available to you, because they only allow plugins that do not seem risky
  - Won’t have full control over databases, files and code
  - Automatic backups are only available on business and higher plans. Lower tier plans would have to use a plugin for backups.
  - Can’t do deep backend customization

### GoDaddy

- Perfect if:
  - Perfect for very few people, I'd highly suggest avoiding this service.
  - You already use GoDaddy for your domain and you want everything in one place.
  - Want an easy but basic building experience and you just need a simple website, such as a business landing page or small personal projects.
  - Just want to get online fast, don't care about having a website builder that will grow with your business needs.
- Skip it if:
  - You don't want to deal with a company known for especially aggressive introductory discounts followed by high renewal prices and known for heavy upselling.
  - You need something more than a basic site.
  - You want to more than bare bones customization.
- Difficulty:
  - ⭐
- Cost:
  - Free: Though you must join the 7 day trial first, and it only has very basic services + have ads on your website, can't use custom domain on the free version.
    https://www.godaddy.com/help/whats-included-in-my-free-websites-marketing-plan-41840
  - Basic: 10.99/mo for 1st year, 203.99 renewal (16.99/mo)
  - Premium: 15.99/mo for 1st year, 359.88 renewal (29.99/mo)
  - Commerce: 21.99/mo for 1st year, $419.88 renewal (34.99/mo)
  - Domain is only free for the first year.
  - Special note: I had to jump through some weird hoops to find the renewal prices without making an account, they don't make it easy to find before you sign up for an account.
  - They will try to sneak in a "Microsoft 365 Email Essentials" plan in, you have to manually click no thanks. It will start off as a free trial, but the renewal price is $179.88/year.
- Trial:
  - 7 day trial
- Customer Support:
  - 24/7 phone, chat and text support, though they offshored so there can be a language barrier.

  - When you contact them for help, you'll have to deal with aggressive upselling. Example: saying the problem will probably be fixed if you upgrade to a new plan versus trying to solve the actual problem.
  - Common complaint is that the responses were unhelpful and had long wait times, if the problem was even resolved at the end.
- Migration:
  - You'd have to rebuild your site from scratch
- Security:
  - Basic security is included (SSL, standard protections).
  - Godaddy has been involved in several security incidents, exposing customer and visitor information, which lead to a class action settlements.
- Accessibility (ADA/WCAG compliance):
  - Limited tools for accessibility checking
  - Minimal accessbility controls, especially compared to Squarespace, Wordpress and Wix.
- How easy to hand-off to employees:
  - You can add an unlimited amount of delegates (collaborators)
  - Different levels of permission, they won't have access to billing information ect

- SEO:
  - "The SEO part of the site builder looks like a good idea, but in reality is an uncustomisable nightmare and is tougher to get results with than a Wordpress site."
  - SEO is lacking in multiple areas: https://www.highervisibility.com/seo/learn/godaddy-seo-review/

- Pros:
  - The website builder is very easy to use since the editor is more structured/simplier.
  - All the basics in one place (website, domain, ssl security, marketing tools) though booking, seo, ect is limited to higher tiers.
  - Has marketing campaign tools where you can send newsletters and basic campaigns.
- Cons:
  - Very limited customization.
  - very limited e-commerce options.
  - "If you're trying to sell anything, the site builder may or may not let you add any products! It's a crap shoot. I tried to alter & change a product for over 30 minutes and it won't do it!"
  - basic analytics, you'd need to hook up to google analytics to get better data.

## When to hire a developer

**1\. You don’t have the time or energy to build a website yourself**

You’ll work with a developer to figure out what your site should look like to achieve your goals. They’ll then deal with creating it for you and make edits as needed.

They can use a website builder so you can easily maintain it once its setup, or they can code a custom website.

**2\. You want to be listed in the top spot for google search results**

Website builders are going to **usually** be “heavier” for the webpage to load than a website that was coded for you. However, If you only use a few apps/ extensions and don't go crazy with the animations or effects, then a website builder's loading speed will likely be fine.

Starting out, website builders will usually be fast enough. As your business gets larger, and you want to increase your SEO ranking (visibility on google search results) this can become more important.

**3\. You’re a larger business and need more advanced features or customization**
